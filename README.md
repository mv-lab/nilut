**TL;DR** NILUT uses neural representations for controllable photorealistic image enhancement. 🚀 [Demo Tutorial](nilut-multiblend.ipynb) and pretrained models available. Try it on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lvhM-QZd2Lc1B3xohHuwJxicHWCrwdws?usp=sharing)!

**3D lookup tables (3D LUTs)** are a key component for image enhancement. Modern image signal processors (ISPs) have dedicated support for these as part of the camera rendering pipeline. Cameras typically provide multiple options for picture styles, where each style is usually obtained by applying a unique handcrafted 3D LUT.

In this work, we propose a Neural Implicit LUT (NILUT), an implicitly defined continuous 3D color transformation parameterized by a neural network. We show that NILUTs are capable of accurately emulating real 3D LUTs. Moreover, a NILUT can be extended to incorporate multiple styles into a single network with the ability to blend styles implicitly. Our novel approach is **memory-efficient, controllable** and can complement previous methods, including **learned ISPs**.

⚠️ ***Website and repo in progress.*** **See also [AISP](https://github.com/mv-lab/AISP)** for image signal processing code and papers.

**Pre-trained models** sample models are available at `models/`. We provide `nilutx3style.pt` a NILUT that encodes three 3D LUT styles (1,3,4) with high accuracy. Download the model [here](https://github.com/mv-lab/nilut/blob/main/models/nilutx3style.pt).

**Demo Tutorial** in [nilut-multiblend.ipynb](nilut-multiblend.ipynb) we provide a simple tutorial on how to use NILUT for multi-style image enhancement and blending. You can run it directly on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lvhM-QZd2Lc1B3xohHuwJxicHWCrwdws?usp=sharing) in a few minutes. The corresponding training code will be released soon.

**Dataset** The complete folder `dataset/` includes 100 images from the Adobe MIT 5K Dataset. The images were processed using professional 3D LUTs on Adobe Lightroom. For demo purposes, we include dataset in [releases](https://github.com/mv-lab/nilut/releases/), you can [download it here](https://github.com/mv-lab/nilut/releases/download/v0/dataset.zip). The structure of the dataset is:

```
dataset/
├── 001_blend.png
├── 001_LUT01.png
├── 001_LUT02.png
├── 001_LUT03.png
├── 001_LUT04.png
├── 001_LUT05.png
├── 001_LUT08.png
├── 001_LUT10.png
└── 001.png
...
```

where `001.png` is the input unprocessed image, `001_LUTXX.png` is the result of applying each corresponding LUT and `001_blend.png` is the example target for evaluating sytle-blending (in the example the blending is between styles 1,3, and 4 with equal weights 0.33). 
The complete dataset includes 100 images `aaa.png` and their enhanced variants for each 3D LUT.


### How do we learn?

We use **Hald** images, a graphical representation of 3D LUT in the form of a color table that contains all of the color gradations of the 3D LUT. Considering the input RGB space Hald, and the resultant one after applying a 3D LUT, we can use such pairs for training our models. You can read the details in our paper Section 4. 

> These images are available (together with the 3D LUT file) in our dataset.
